## What is channel

* channel components
    * linear channel
    * y(t) = Kx(t-t_d)
    * y(f) = F[y(t)] = Kexp(j\omega t_d)X(f) 
    * \omega = 2\pi f

## Some problems
* [channel fading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fading)
    * fast and slow fading 
    * block fading
    * selective fading
* phase delay
* path loss
