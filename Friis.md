# Friis transmission equation

```diff
Introduction
1. Friis transmission formula
    ・ equating the power at the terminals of a recv antenna
    ・ the product of 
        1. power density of the incident wave 
        2. the effective aperture(A) of the receiving antenna under idealized conditions given another antenna some distance away transmitting a known amount of power.
